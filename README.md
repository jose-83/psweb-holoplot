holoplot challenge code and its solution

The src folder contains contains the challenge question and the simple service that provided by Holoplot.
I have added a dockerfile there in case of someone does not want to install python or its requirements. Using docker one can just run the service within a container.

The solution is available on solution1 branch.
Switch to test-solution folder. Read and follow instructions in the readme file in that folder.

Good luck!
