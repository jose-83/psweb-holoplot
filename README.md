holoplot challenge code and its solution

The src folder contains the challenge question and the simple service that provided by Holoplot.
I have added a dockerfile there in case of someone does not want to install python or its requirements. Using docker one can just run the service within a container to see how does it work.

The solution is available in test-solution folder.
Read and follow instructions in the Readme file in that folder.

Good luck!
